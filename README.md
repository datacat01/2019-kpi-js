# We chose [Obfuscator IO](https://obfuscator.io/) for obfuscation.
Team consists of:
- Pavlo Pyvovar
- Olha Pashnieva
- Vladyslav Zalevskyi

`data/` folder contains clear and obfuscated files in corresponding repositories and features we calculated for them.

`src/` folder contains all the source files used to parse, obfuscate and extract features.

Folders with our surnames contain mainly drafts, and will be eventually deleted with all the usefull code moved to `src/`
