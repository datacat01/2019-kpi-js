# We chose [Obfuscator IO](https://obfuscator.io/) for obfuscation.
Team consists of:
- Pavlo Pyvovar
- Olha Pashnieva
- Vladyslav Zalevskyi

`data/` folder contains clear and obfuscated files in corresponding repositories and features we calculated for them. Along with features provided by Samsung and other team members in folder `data/features_extended`

`src/` folder contains all the source files used to parse, obfuscate, extract features, visualise and classify.
